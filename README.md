INTRODUCTION 

Career guidance is the guidance given to individuals to help them acquire the knowledge, 
information, skills, and experience necessary to identify career options, and narrow them down to 
make one career decision. This career decision then results in their social, financial and emotional 
well-being throughout. 
A Career Guidance System where students can see various career opportunities, the system shows 
various fields available after 12th, for graduation and also fields available after graduation. It also 
lists various colleges available where students can search colleges by their courses. Next the 
system allows users to give a test. It is actually a series of tests of various general questions. After 
test completion a score is calculated for each test. Based on those results the system manipulates 
and calculates the best career for that user. This result is then emailed to that user. The system also 
consists of an admin module. The admin can login to the system and enter colleges along with 
their specifications. 

Choosing the Right Career 

For people who find it difficult to realize the right career meant for them; a career guide helps them 
sort this confusion. There are infinite career options available to choose from, and without an 
expert’s proper guidance, one might stick to a few that his/her friends or relatives ask him to 
pursue. An informed career guide makes one aware about the scope of every career option in detail, 
which widens the horizon for the student. For people who think they are clear on their career paths 
and have attained enough clarity to work towards a chosen career option Career guides ensure that 
they achieve their goals without any distractions.
